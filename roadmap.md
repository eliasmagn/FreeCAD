# Roadmap

## Completed

- 2025-10-05 — Delivered the Sketcher "Split Edge at Point" tool, enabling constraint-safe curve subdivision directly at existing vertices or reference points.
- 2025-10-06 — Ensured split operations retain angle constraints on resulting segments and added regression coverage.

## In Progress

- Collect feedback on the selection workflow and tolerance handling for the split-at-point tool to determine whether additional UX refinements are required.

## Planned

- Extend automated testing coverage for Sketcher curve-editing commands, including split, extend, and trim variants.
